# Cbuy is a mockup of ebay. Where users are able to make purchases and contact the site for any questions.

# My bootstrap components are the carousel on the home page to show off the sales that the website is providing.

- As well as the table underneath the carousel to give out the dates and discounts the website will have
- The Nav bar for a better look as well as a responsive feel for smaller screens
- The Footer for the same purpose.
- Form in the Contact us form.
- Cards used to show the products on the catalog page.

# Javascript functions are mainly for validation for the email in the contact us page and to send an alert to notify user that

# they have created sent in a form. Changes the color of the outline of the email box and font of the email input to inform user that

# the email validation is correct of incorrect.

# Another Javascript function that is added is used to fetch the products.json file to be able to create a catalog page instead of doing

# each product one by one I created a function to loop through the json file to catch all items and create a separate card for each item.

<!-- IMPORTANT -->

# Each javascript file is separated into the correct folder where they are required. Folders that javascript files can be found are:

    - Catalog
    - Contact
